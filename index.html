            <p class="review-text">We had a wonderful stay at this charming little place in Sri Lanka. With only four rooms, it felt peaceful and private — perfect for a relaxing getaway. The location is excellent, just a short walk from the beautiful nine arch bridge, which was a highlight of our trip. What truly stood out was the hospitality. We requested specific food options, and they went out of their way to make sure everything we wanted was available — the food was absolutely delicious! They also kindly helped us arrange a room for our driver, which we really appreciated. Overall, a warm and welcoming experience. Highly recommended! Tip - the two rooms on the top will get you some privacy and a good view on the mountains from the balcony located outside the rooms.</p>

            <p class="review-text">A budget-friendly stay close to Nine Arches Bridge with kind service and decent comfort for a night or two. Shiva (the caretaker) is incredibly accommodating and friendly. We would consider staying again the next time we’re in Ella. 😊</p>

            <p class="review-text">Our stay at Shiimmer-Ella guesthouse was amazing. The owner was very communicative and answer all my questions very quickly.
The Onsite hostess Kanti was a gem. She made our stay here so wonderful. She is an incredible cook 🧑‍🍳 and prepared us wonderful authentic Sri Lankan Curries and our favourite Sambol as well as delicious breakfasts with fresh fruit we love ❤️. Her rotis and crepes were so well prepared and delicious. She found us transportation by tuk tuk . In addition to her amazing cooking skills she also responded immediately when she found I had a 🥶 cold. She got me the medicine I needed and ginger and fresh fruit and prepared a line steam bowl that restored my breathing. Both the owner and Kanti checked in on me until I felt better. The room itself was spacious clean with a soft bed and pillows. The bathroom was great with a wonderful hot shower. The view from our room was amazing overlooking a lush jungle valley. We enjoyed our stay immensely for three nights. It is so close to the nine arch bridge that one can walk the 1.5 km which we did in the early morning around 6 am. It is the best time to go to avoid the crowds. One could get to anywhere in Ella by tuk tuk easily. We actually walked to the junction where one go to Ella in less than 40 minutes where there is lots of tuk tuk waiting to take to you anywhere. Amazing jungle and countryside. Kanti though really made our stay at Shiimmer-Ella a 10. She is the hostess with the best attitude. We will be back. Thanks Kanti 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉</p>
